## Notes on Testing

As requested, I have used **Pest** and **Livewire**.
Since these are tools I am currently adopting, you may find specific comments in the code (specifically in the Profile Update test).
Thank you for the opportunity to participate in this process. I enjoyed the challenge of working with Livewire and Pest.


- [x] Setup Laravel project with Livewire starter kit.
- [x] Add image field for User's avatar.
- [x] Integration of `pestphp/pest-plugin-browser`.
- [x] Browser tests for Login & Register.
- [x] Livewire test for Profile editing.
